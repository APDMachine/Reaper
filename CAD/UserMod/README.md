UserMods

*CAD SKILLS REQUIRED*
Use these step files to customize your Reaper for even more personilization.

For grill inserts build from the inside out keeping within the lipped ring. Try not to exceed 5.6mm total or travel could be affected.

Grill Logos, just cut out your own, real easy.

If you are using sensorless homing on a machine that does not use standard printed XY joints, be they carbon, laser, cnc. Use the BumStop files to make your own to match the thickness and geometry of your setup.

The SaladFork BumStops could possibly be used to make mods for Micron printers.

We do NOT recommend using Reaper on anything smaller than a 160 build for any reason. But if you want to be ridiculous just to be ridiculous then we wont stop you!

As always if your usermods work, please post them on the discord so others may have access. We will come up with links to them later.
