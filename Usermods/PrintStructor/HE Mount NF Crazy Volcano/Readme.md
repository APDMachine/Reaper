# Hotend Mount for Mellow NF Crazy Volcano (should also work for Mosquito Magnum)

I designed the opening for the fan on the front so that there is as much open space as possible. The air is then channelled cleanly to the rear directly to the heatbreak and flows around it optimally. I also created 2 optional holes at the top for a complete screw connection of the fan. The upper attachment point for the two hotend screws was given small fixing points for mounting and the screw guides were adapted to the screw length of the hotend. Overall, the hotend has been moved upwards by several mm so that it is now at the same height as the REVO. The ducts should now be optimally aligned with the nozzle.  

This modifies the TAP extruder mount for the VZ Hextrudort (low) extruder. `STL/Extruder Mounts/TAP/HextrudortLOW CNC TAP.stl`

All it really does, is moves the extruder another 4mm away from the hotend, allowing the tension screw to *just* clear the right 5015 fan.

I've been testing it for about 48hr worth of prints, and it's working as expected!

This is what it looks like all together.
