# Hotend Mount for Mellow NF Crazy Volcano (should also work for Mosquito Magnum)

I designed the opening for the fan on the front so that there is as much open space as possible. The air is then channelled cleanly to the rear directly to the heatbreak and flows around it optimally. I also created 2 optional holes at the top for a complete screw connection of the fan.

The upper attachment point for the two hotend screws was given small fixing points for mounting and the screw guides were adapted to the screw length of the hotend. Overall, the hotend has been moved upwards by several mm so that it is now at the same height as the Rapido. The ducts should now be optimally aligned with the nozzle. I have removed some material in the lower area so that it is easier to get to the rear with the cable from the thermistor or heater.
