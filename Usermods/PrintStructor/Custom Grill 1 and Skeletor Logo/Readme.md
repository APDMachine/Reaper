Here you can find a custom grill insert in cheese grater design. I have also released the stealth skirts for the VORON 2.4 and Trident to match. 

I've also added the good old He-Man Skeletor logo and repositioned and lengthened the lower mounting clamp of the grill shell so that it now rests against the underside of the hotend mount.

The upper attachment point for the two hotend screws was given small fixing points for mounting and the screw guides were adapted to the screw length of the hotend. Overall, the hotend has been moved upwards by several mm so that it is now at the same height as the REVO. The ducts should now be optimally aligned with the nozzle. I have removed some material in the lower area so that it is easier to get to the rear with the cable from the thermistor or heater.
