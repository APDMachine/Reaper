Here you can find a custom grill insert in cheese grater design. I have also released the stealth skirts for the VORON 2.4 and Trident to match. 

I've also added the good old He-Man Skeletor logo and repositioned and lengthened the lower mounting clamp of the grill shell so that it now rests against the underside of the hotend mount.
