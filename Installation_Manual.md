# Installation Manual
This is actually the 4th version of this toolhead that I’ve been working on so
while not completely experimental, you are the first people to have access to
this besides me. I appreciate constructive even critical feedback. If you have
any questions you can contact me directly via:

Since I don’t have a manual done up yet… Everything is fairly straight
forward, but here’s just a few notes on assembly.

1 - I recommend (as I always do with new things) doing a dry assembly first off the machine to get the basics down. 
Minus the carriage everything can be removed as a whole. 
Or you can remove the hotend and parts cooling as it’s own. Or just the ducts. 
Should make maintenance a bit easier. 
The two lower screws connecting the MountPlate to the Carriage are accessible from the front past the ducts.
The two top ones are installed from the rear.

2 - The ducts and grill get tied together to form a sub assembly and is the last thing to install, you can use your allen through the top opening to screw them
together.
The Grill insert can be glued in place (working on making it snap fit is on theto-do list) if press fit doesn’t work.
The upper logo plate gets glued to the LightPlate. 
A few drops of CA is more than sufficient and the ring self aligns it. 
Then that can then be inserted, slid it up from under the duct mount tabs and press fit into place.
> [!CAUTION]
> Use CAUTION when installing the LEDs, they require some pressure but
shouldn’t be forced into place or you’ll snap the mounts. I’ve found rotating
them into place with a pair of blunt end tweezers works best. 
This area is where I will most likely need more improvement.

3 - Once you mount the hotend, install PTFE tube into the opening til it
bottoms out in the heatbreak, then just flush cut it with the top of the mount.
De-burr/Flare the inside at the edge.

4 - Actually that step applies to the extruder as well, mount it and again flush
cut your PTFE tubing with the bottom of the plate. De-burr/Flare the inside at
the edge.

5 - If you’ve done those steps proper there should be less than, 0.1-0.15mm
between the two when the hotend mount gets slid into place and filament
should not snag. There are provisions for 4 screws to fasten the 2 together,
they are angled on purpose so even with the ducts on they can all be
removed as one unit. (yay for modularity!). Depending on how quick you’re
running start with only 2 if weight is a concern.

6 - Other than those it’s pretty basic. Consult the CAD or contact me for any
missing info.
***The whole toolhead should be very rigid when assembled, one thing I’ve
always strived for and this is the best I’ve gotten yet.***
