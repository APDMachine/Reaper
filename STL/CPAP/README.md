This is a first iteration on CPAP integration for Reaper. 
THESE PARTS ARE STILL UNDERGOING DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGES.

***You will need to add support to the bottom sections of the interface as well as under the mount ear. There is an image on the Discord in #reapers-blow-cpap showing where. These are the only places supports are needed until we sort out built in supports in the model.***
